# pydia
## The ultimate Python wrapper for the Microsoft DIA SDK (Debug Interface Access)
---
## Goal
**pydia** aims to ease the manual handling of PDB files. No more hacking together some IDA-Python - you can now use your favorite python ditribution and simply install a package!
**pydia** makes all the common functionality used when working with PDB files extremely accessible.
### My future vision
Hopefully, we can make pydia so powerful we will be able to accurately recreate header files from PDBs alone.
